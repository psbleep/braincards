braincards is a punchcards-inspired interface for writing code that can be executed by a personal computer. The project takes images of graph paper filled in to represent binary numbers, which are converted to [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) code and executed by a Brainfuck interpreter.

## Dependencies
